                        from the level of their mythic form, and it starts at
                        level 1. Note that they're typically still very strong
                        at level 1, but the upgrades are notable increases in
                        strength. Level 1 to level 6 is fairly easy to get, and
                        is worth going for right after unlocking an Immortal. To
                        level them up you need Immortal Stones instead of Mythic

                    None of the Immortals are directly affected by Mythic
                    Treasures. It's worth noting that the first 3 all do benefit
                    from them on the way to summon them. The Mythic Frog's
                    treasure gives some material back if a curse lift is failed.
                    This means that it's easier to try again after each failed
                    curse lift. Mama's treasure lets her summon imps more
                    quickly. Hailey's treasure allows her to gather Star Power
                    more quickly. All of these effects speed up their ability to
                    turn into their immortal form, but once in the form they
                    don't hold these treasures or benefit from any of the

                    In Hell and God Mode, there's a boss called Night Shaman

                    with more damage, because it gives your board some

                <p>
                    Reaper Frog is a Physical Damage DPS Guardian. He's easy to
                    summon, and he does good damage. He has two forms: Frog
                    Form, and Dian Form. Unlike the Mythic Frog Form, Immortal
                    Reaper Frog is a very solid DPS unit. He has damage
                    comparative to Lazy Taoist or Overclocked Rocket Chu. He's
                    also much cheaper to summon than Rocket Chu, which is very
                    good since they both have a chance to die when being
                    summoned, meaning the risk is lower when summoning Reaper
                    Frog, although Rocket Chu does have a higher success rate at
                    50% versus Frogs 35%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reaper Frog's summon cost is low enough that at Luck Stone
                    level 6+, he can somewhat consistently be summoned before
                    wave 20 on Hell Mode. Since all you have to do is get a King
                    Dian, you'll get a Reaper Frog on average within 3 tries. He
                    can easily carry until wave 40, usually including the wave
                    40 boss. This makes him a great unit to allow you to stack
                    econ, and slowly build the rest of your board. He also
                    applies 80 slow to enemies with his skill "Suppression",
                    which is overall a great skill to have as it prevents stun
                    leaks. For comparison, the Mythic Guardian Coldy applies 50
                    slow with her passive, and 50 slow with her skill, and
                    Penguin Musician applies 60 with his skill. So Reaper Frog's
                    80 slow is one of the stronger slows in the game.

                <p>
                    Reaper Dian is a Magic Damage DPS Guardian. When you get
                    Reaper Frog, you can do the same curse lift ability the
                    standard frog has to transform him into Reaper Dian. It has
                    a 35% chance to succeed by default, increasing to a 50%
                    chance to succeed at level 12. Overall, this means the odds
                    of succeeding in both transformations is 12.25% normally,
                    and is raised to 17.5% at level 12. Or, 1 Reaper Dian every
                    8 regular Frogs 1 Reaper Dian per 6 regular Frogs at level
                    12. Reaper Dian is a significant upgrade overall. There have
                    been videos of high level players clearing Hell Mode with
                    Reaper Dian as the only DPS on the board. His skills and
                    passives all revolve around dealing massive damage.

                <h2>How to Summon</h2>
                <p>
                    Reaper Frog is the easiest to summon out of the first 3
                    Immortal Guardians. To get a him, all you need to do is turn
                    a normal frog into a Dian. Once you get a Dian, at any point
                    you will be able to convert it into a Reaper Frog. From
                    there, you can try to curse lift your Reaper Frog, into his
                    Reaper Dian Form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get a Reaper Dian more easily, you can keep making Dians
                    from the normal Mythic Frog. When you have both a Dian and a
                    Reaper Frog on the board, if you try to lift the curse on
                    the Frog and it fails, you can immediately turn your Dian
                    into a Reaper Frog. You can use this strategy to make
                    multiple attempts at Reaper Dian, without having to give up
                    having his base Frog Form if you fail.

                    from her skills, you'd need this much gold to get the same
                    bonus from Money Gun:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>285k gold at Money Gun 1</li>
                    <li>259k gold at Money Gun 2</li>
                    <li>238k gold at Money Gun 3</li>
                    <li>219k gold at Money Gun 4</li>
                    <li>204k gold at Money Gun 5</li>
                    <li>190k gold at Money Gun 6</li>
                    <li>178k gold at Money Gun 7</li>

                    <li>140k gold at Money Gun 11</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This makes her especially good for lower sb/mg players and
                    also particularly good for shorter game modes (PvP, guild
                    battle, underground cave, daily dungeon) where Safe Box
                    doesn't have time to grow gold to a significant level. Even
                    at higher Safe Box levels, she is a really strong Wave Clear
                    and is always worth a summon.

                    Grand Mama is a Support Guardian that deals Magic DMG. She's
                    cheap to get on the board if you can get Mythic Mama
                    summoned before wave 10. She's difficult to summon later in
                    the game though. She applies a variety of buffs and debuffs
                    through passives and skills:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>+225% or higher damage to the whole board (passive)</li>
                    <li>Increases DMG taken by 15% (skill)</li>
                    <li>Reduces healing by 50% (skill)</li>
                    <li>
                        Revives a random Mythic unit every 5 Mythic deaths (ULT)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    NOTE: The revival skill counts failed Frog Curse Lifts,
                    failed Chu Overclocks, and even Tar Cannibalisms. At level
                    12, this skill triggers on every 3 deaths instead of 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Hell Mode, she can go to wave 40, but she will struggle
                    to clear the wave 40 boss. Her damage is comparable to Lazy
                    Taoist/Overclocked Rocket Chu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grand Mama shines particularly well in PvP. In PvP, players
                    don't typically get enough gold to get large damage bonuses
                    from Money Gun. With Grand Mama level 6, you can get a
                    minimum of +225% damage from her passive bonus.

                </p>
                <h2>Assimilation Details</h2>
                <p>
                    Assimilation is an interesting skill. On paper, it sounds
                    extremely powerful. In the right circumstances (pvp) it is.
                    But in coop, it won't go as far as you think. This is
                    because the damage bonus for Assimilation only applies to a
                    characters base damage. This is different than Money Gun,
                    because Money Gun stacks with other types of damage, like
                    Mythic Damage Upgrade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The short version is basically, after you reach 100k+
                    damage, less than 5% of your damage is going to be coming
                    from Grand Mama's damage buff. However, in PvP players won't
                    be getting that much gold anyways. This means that a +225%
                    buff is going to be much more impactful. Since it's not
                    dwarfed by the typical Money Gun damage buff.
                </p>
                <h2>How to Summon</h2>
                <p>
                    To summon a Grand Mama, you need to have at least 9 imps
                    summoned by Mythic Mama. When you get 9 imps or more, the
                    button to summon Grand Mama will show on screen. When
                    pressed, she'll be summoned and absorb all the imps. Each
                    imp will give a +10% ATK buff, unless she's level 6, where
                    she'll instead give a +25% ATK buff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a harder to accomplish in hell mode. The increased
                    health of Hell Mode enemies makes it so that Mama's ult
                    stops killing enemies much earlier. If you don't get a Mama
                    before wave 10, you're likely going to have a hard time
                    getting 9 imps. Even if you do, it's still going to take
                    luck to get them. For this reason, Grand Mama is only really
                    viable if you have Mama's exclusive treasure.

                    Primeval Bomba is a Physical Damage DPS guardian. There
                    isn't a large direct commitment to getting Primeval Bomba,
                    as you only need Bomba on the board to be able to get
                    Primeval Bomba. Attack speed buffs help get Primeval Bomba
                    more consistently, which is good because it's a buff you
                    want to build up anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His Primeval Form has two main differences, the basic
                    attack, and the ultimate. The basic attack does not have a
                    workout effect to strengthen it, instead, it just does 500%
                    area damage at base, meaning Primeval Bomba does not need to
                    build up stacks for full power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other main difference is the ultimate changes to
                    cooldown-based instead of MP-based so MP Regen effects stop
                    working on it. Primeval Bomba's ult also ignores some
                    defense, which can be important in the late game. If you're
                    around 40 below the desired DR, Primeval Bomba will still do
                    major bonus damage in ultimate form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His main role is being a top tier Wave Clear unit. Because
                    his wave clear is so strong, this frees you up to summon
                    units who are really bad at wave clear such as Watt or
                    Vayne, without worrying about if you can survive the waves.
                    You'll have good all around coverage for the entire game if
                    you take advantage of this, so always make sure to pair him
                    with a good boss killer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lance works as well, but keep in mind he takes a melee
                    space. Multiple Lances will end up fighting for space with
                    Bomba, so realistically you'll only want 1 Lance next to
                    your Bomba so they can attack at the same time.

                <p>
                    Primeval Bomba is summoned by Bomba having max workout
                    stacks, and then every basic attack has a 0.1% chance for
                    Primeval Bomba to be able to be summoned. Workout stacks are
                    given by chance every basic attack Bomba does, this means
                    summoning Primeval Bomba is ALL about basic attacks, so to
                    speed up Primeval Bomba's activation, you will want a lot of
                    attack speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A note for attack speeds, all attack speed buffs become more
                    effective the more UNIQUE sources of attack speed there are.
                    This means 2 eagles and 2 frogs is better than 6 eagles for
                    example, even though they both only technically give 30%
                    attack speed. So for maximum effectiveness, you will want
                    many different sources of attack speed to speed up the

                <p>Ghost Ninja is a Physical Damage DPS guardian.</p>
                <p>
                    His base ATK is the lowest of the DPS Immortals. His passive
                    is Critical Hit-based so there’s no control over it. His
                    Execution and Throw skills have multipliers that are only
                    slightly better than Rocket Chu. His ult Guillotine sounds
                    like it is a boss killer move with its 50000% Physical DMG
                    on one target but Awakened Hailey’s ult actually deals
                    112500% damage over its entire duration and has splash.
                </p>
                <p>In conclusion, Ghost Ninja is rather unremarkable.</p>

                <h2>How to Summon</h2>
                <p>
                    Sacrifice one Ninja with an 11-combo from Assassinate and 4
                    additional Ninjas. Combos are counted based on how many
                    times Assassinate reactivates (55% reactivation chance).
                    Ninja’s exclusive treasure Sharp Shuriken further increases
                    the reactivation chance of Assassinate by up to 15%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On paper, it seems like Shadow Ninja is really easy to
                    summon. You have to summon 5 Ninjas anyway to sacrifice for
                    the immortal form. The cost of 5 Ninjas isn’t super
                    expensive (5 epics, 10 rares). But in practice, the issue is
                    having enemies exist which can survive a 10-combo such that
                    your Ninjas can complete an 11-combo. As such you have to
                    juggle a fine balance between too many Ninjas killing
                    enemies too fast, your teammate killing enemies too fast,
                    and losing the game due to not dealing enough damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Hard and God mode, you have the dungeon with bosses where
                    your Ninjas can attempt their 11-combos non-stop but this
                    will compete for spots with Bandits for gold farming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, 5 Ninjas out of 18 spots on the board is a lot
                    of space taken up. Ninja is also a Physical DPS and hence
                    needs Defense Reduction on top of the usual stun setup. This
                    means that attempting to summon Shadow Ninja only makes more
                    sense in Hard and God with the Dungeon to have a better
                    chance to get the 11-combo in time and more space to fit all
                    the 5 Ninjas and Defense Reduction.

                <p>
                    Chrono Ato is a very strong Physical Focused Support. He
                    increases your DEF Reduction by 50%, allowing you to devote
                    less of your board to DR. He also increases physical DMG Ult
                    DMG, and reduces cooldown for guardians with cooldown based
                    ULTs. (Verdee, Chu, Immortal Bomba, Ninja)
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also slows enemies, so not only does he increase damage
                    but he helps your stun by preventing leakage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often Ato ascends to Chrono Ato pretty late game. This is
                    okay, because the most notable bonus from his immortal form
                    is the +50% defense reduction bonus. This works out pretty
                    well timing-wise because in general you don't need high
                    defense reduction numbers until very late game anyways, like
                    wave 65 or so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's also worth considering that to even ascend Ato, he
                    needs to reduce friendly cooldowns by 100 seconds (see
                    below) so your playstyle will need to involve a solid amount
                    of guardians with cooldown based ults, not just mana based
                    ults.

                    the immortal summon condition is relatively easy to attain.
                    The tradeoff is that he is one of the weakest immortals thus

                    Dr. Pulse is summoned once you charge a total of 10,000
                    energy with Pulse Generator. Putting him next to your stun
                    setup will practically guarantee summoning Dr. Pulse. Note
                    that creating his drones consumes your stun robots. You want
                    to make sure that you have surplus stuns on the board before
                    consuming any to form drones. You will lose the game without
                    stuns.

                    Vayne and Ato have a very strong synergy overall, going both
                    ways. If you play a bunch of Vaynes, Ato will ascend to
                    Chrono Ato very quickly. If you play a bunch of Atos, Vayne
                    can stay in ult form much longer.

                    Mage, Ato is required when using Vayne as your boss killer.
                    Unless you spam Atos, you can't use Vayne to kill bosses the

                    Rocket Chu has always been one of the strongest mythics in
                    the entire game. This was before the game had Ato buffing
                    his damage and his cooldown. Now that Ato is in the game,
                    Chu can ult constantly. Immortal Bomba is also much stronger
                    with Ato. Now, all these things are in sync since they all
                    benefit from Ato. While Vayne can't reliably perma ult
                    anymore, the overall improved synergy makes using her
                    easier.

                <p>
                    Her Immortal Form is very strong. Unlike Vayne, Top Vayne
                    doesn't rely on tumbling. Her main sources of damage at
                    level 6 are Golden Arrow and Rupture Arrow. Golden Arrow
                    causes every 3rd attack on the same target to do 7000%
                    damage (70x damage). Rupture Arrow triggers every 15
                    attacks, and causes a 5 second damage over time effect. This
                    DoT effect causes 3300% dmg every half a second for those 5
                    seconds. This is the equivalent of 33,000% dmg overall, or
                    330x damage. Rupture Arrow also does an additional 10%
                    damage for each point of the targets DEF stat. In God Mode
                    this would be an extra 1750% damage every half second, or
                    17,500% over 5 seconds, an additional 175x damage. Adding
                    both together this would be 50,500%, or 505x damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as Arrow Explosion, I've seen underwhelming results
                    from this skill. Considering every 3rd attack from Vayne
                    does 7000% damage, Arrow Explosion only stacking 1000%
                    damage per attack that can be triggered later doesn't sound
                    particularly impressive. Especially considering how strong
                    Rupture Arrow is. Her ult does influence the viability here.
                    Her attack speed increases up to 150% when using her Ult,
                    and each attack stacks two explosive arrows instead of one.
                    Considering that Her ult improves attack speed even more at
                    level 12, this could be a stronger ability then but
                    considering this also benefits Golden Arrow and Rupture
                    Arrow, it seems comparatively underwhelming. This potential
                    is also limited behind a high amount of Ato spam.
                    Theoretically, the best strategy to maximize this ult would
                    be to only run a single Vayne, in hopes of spamming even
                    more Atos in place of other would-be Vayne's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, Vayne has a great immortal form. If you don't see
                    huge bursts of damage from Arrow Explosion that's fine -
                    Arrow Explosion appears to be the less powerful abilities.
                    Expect most of your damage to come from Rupture Arrow and
                    Golden Arrow, these are your bread and butter. Pursuing big
                    Arrow Explosion results isn't the reccommended approach,
                    however, after every ult, you should still trigger Arrow
                    Explosion, because of the increased Attack SPD and double
                    stacking, that's when the stacks will be at their peak. Even
                    then, the main damage will be those other two skills, and
                    you should expect only a little extra damage from Arrow
                    Explosion.

                    Super Graviton is a support guardian. The immortal form is
                    more varied in its crowd control than the mythic form. The
                    stun effect stuns for 0.9s every second for 4s. After
                    factoring in the -50% stun duration from Hard onwards, it
                    will only stun for 0.45s per second each time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In exchange for the weaker stun, Super Graviton grants a
                    damage boost to your board, slow, and the ult has a suction
                    ability. These work to keep enemies in one spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To enforce a secure stunlock, you need to pair Super
                    Graviton with 1-2 mythic Gravitons. The Super Graviton will
                    stun incoming units every second and the Graviton(s) will
                    keep the units stunned due to their long stun duration. This
                    helps you to save unit capacity and/or board space.

                <h2>How to Summon</h2>
                <p>
                    Super Graviton can be summoned when Graviton’s Overheat
                    gauge reaches 100. Charging the Overhead gauge requires
                    consuming other Gravitons, with each one increasing the
                    gauge by 15-35 points. So you need to consume 3 to 7 Gravs
                    to summon a Super Graviton, plus one more doing the
                    consuming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the summon cost less prohibitive, the exclusive
                    treasure is crucial as it increases the Overheat gauge
                    charged per Grav consumed. It is highly recommended to get
                    the exclusive treasure to level 6 to make the summon cost
                    only 2 to 4 Gravs instead of 3 to 7. At level 8+, it reduces
                    further to 2 to 3 Gravs.

                <p>
                    Dark Lord Dragon can be summoned when you have 1 Drain and 1
                    Dragon on the board. The two main obstacles to summoning him
                    is getting 8 Eagles to merge a Great Egg (to awaken Drain)
                    and a Dragon Egg (to awaken a Dragon) and waiting for the
                    eggs to hatch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People generally suggest forming the Dragon Egg first to
                    provide some DPS early on. However, if you are lucky with
                    Eagles in your epic roulette, you can consider going for
                    Drain first.
